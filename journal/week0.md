### 3. AWS CLI

I was able to connect Gitpod to my Github and launched Gitpod on the browser to access my workspace.
To ensure that the AWS CLI is installed automatically everytime I open the workspace, the workspace below was added in the gitpod.yaml file

``` ruby
cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

### 4. AWS Cloudshell

I accessed the AWS Cloudshell and ran some commands to enable auto prompt and find my Account ID

### 5. AWS Budget

I created a budget using both the CLI method and the UI method. When creating the budget using CLI, I used the code below:

<details><summary><b>Json Code to create budget</b></summary>
<p>


```json
   {
    "BudgetLimit": {
        "Amount": "1",
        "Unit": "USD"
    },
    "BudgetName": "Example Tag Budget",
    "BudgetType": "COST",
    "CostFilters": {
        "TagKeyValue": [
            "user:Key$value1",
            "user:Key$value2"
        ]
    },
    "CostTypes": {
        "IncludeCredit": true,
        "IncludeDiscount": true,
        "IncludeOtherSubscription": true,
        "IncludeRecurring": true,
        "IncludeRefund": true,
        "IncludeSubscription": true,
        "IncludeSupport": true,
        "IncludeTax": true,
        "IncludeUpfront": true,
        "UseBlended": false
    },
    "TimePeriod": {
        "Start": 1477958399,
        "End": 3706473600
    },
    "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY"
}
```
